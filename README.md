The goal of the software project is to work in teams of 2 and create an application that
has an authentication login to access a database of humidity and temperature values and plot these
values, while making use of cloud services. 

The team of Andre Gonzaga and Shivani Singhdecided to proceed with Google authentication 
and Google Storage for the sake of uniformity. The Firebase Documentation was an important 
resource in hitting each objective. The team used an iOS platform in conjunction of Firebase. 
Firebase is an app development platform provided by Google. Through Firebase, the team 
create an authentication login and made use of Google Storage, which is Google's cloud
platform. The team used SQLite, a relational database management system, to create a database
of the temperature and humidity numbers. 

Firebase stores the users' login credentials. There is a unique UID for each user. Once the user 
logs into the application, he/she can "click" a button to create the database of values and "click"
another button to access and read the textfile of values. These values are stored in Google Storage. 

Andre Gonzaga worked on the database and cloud services components of the project; Shivani Singh
worked on the authentication component. Unfortunately, with Xcode and Swift, there isn't an 
automatic merging system. Both team members got together, and manually combined their 
respective components of the project together. There is a video that captures the use of the application, 
which will be emailed to Professor Osama, because GitHub does not support video uploads.
