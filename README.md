# EC463MiniProject

The goal of the software project is to work in teams of 2 and create an application that
has an authentication login to access a database of humidity and temperature values and plot these
values, while making use of cloud services. 

The team of Andre Gonzaga and Shivani Singh used an iOS platform in conjunction of Firebase. 
Firebase is an app development platform provided by Google. Through Firebase, the team 
create an authentication login and made use of Google Storage, which is Google's cloud
platform. The team used SQLite, a relational database management system, to create a database
of the temperature and humidity numbers. 

Firebase stores the users' login credentials. Once the user logs into the application, he/she
can "click" a button to access the database of values. These values are stored in Google Storage. 

Andre Gonzaga worked on the database and cloud services components of the project; Shivani Singh
worked on the authentication component. Unfortunately, with Xcode and Swift, there isn't an 
automatic merging system. Both team members got together, and manually combined their 
respective components of the project together.
